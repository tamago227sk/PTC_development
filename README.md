## Overview

This repository provides a framework for developing and validating software for the **Power and Timing Card (PTC)**. <br>
The immediate objectives are:

1. Bring up a PTC-side service (`ptc_server`).
2. Validate basic register access (direct `peek`, followed by client → server → hardware access). 
3. Establish the foundation for slow-control extensions such as I2C sensor reads, EEPROM identification, and WIB-facing monitoring once the full hardware test stand becomes available.

```
### Notes:

- Python utilities are located inside `src/` so they can directly import the generated protobuf module `ptc_pb2.py`.
- The protobuf files (`ptc.pb.cc`, `ptc.pb.h`, `ptc_pb2.py`) are generated automatically during `build.sh`.
- Compiled binaries such as `ptc_server` and `peek` are build artifacts and should not be committed.

---
## Network Model

The PTC is operated on a **private network with no internet access**.

As a result:

- The repository must be cloned on a machine with internet access (e.g. DUNE server)
- The code must then be transferred to the PTC manually (e.g. via `scp`)
- Dependencies must already exist on the PTC or be manually installed

Typical workflow:

DUNE Server (internet)
    ↓ git clone
    ↓ scp
PTC (no internet)
    ↓ build.sh

---
## Dependencies

Typical build requirements include:

* C++ compiler 
* `protoc` (Protocol Buffers compiler)
* ZeroMQ 
* Python 3

### Dependency Setup (DUNE → PTC)
#### On DUNE server (download only)
```
git clone https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq.git
git clone https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf.git

tar -czf deps.tar.gz libzmq protobuf
```
#### Copy to PTC server
```
scp deps.tar.gz root@<PTC_IP>:~
```

#### On PTC server (build dependencies)
```
tar -xzf deps.tar.gz

cd libzmq
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j2
make install
ldconfig

cd ../protobuf
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j2
make install
ldconfig
```

---

## Software Architecture

The control stack is structured as a lightweight client–server model.

<pre>
DUNE Server
    │
    │ ZMQ (REQ/REP)
    │
    ▼
PTC Server (ptc_server)
    │
    │ register access via /dev/mem
    │
    ▼
PTC FPGA registers
</pre>

Client utilities communicate with the PTC through a ZeroMQ REQ/REP socket.
Commands are serialized using Protocol Buffers.

Main layers:

1. **Client layer**
   - `ptc_client.py`
   - sends commands (`peek`, `poke`, `ping`)

2. **Transport layer**
   - ZeroMQ REQ/REP messaging

3. **Command serialization**
   - protobuf messages (`ptc.proto`)

4. **Server dispatch**
   - `ptc_server.cxx`

5. **Hardware access**
   - `ptc.cc` → `/dev/mem` register mapping

## PTC Bring-Up Quickstart (Port 7820)

This section describes the initial bring-up procedure for a **fresh PTC microSD image** and a **DUNE server machine** connected via Ethernet.

The goal is to validate the following:

1. Network connectivity to the PTC
2. Direct register access on the PTC
3. Operation of the `ptc_server` ZMQ service
4. Successful client → server → hardware register read


### Assumptions

* The PTC boots successfully from the microSD image.
* Login access to the PTC as `root` is available.
* `ptc_server` is configured to bind to **TCP port 7820**.
* PTC address is **127.0.0.1** (set as default).
* **Those need to be updated once address is confirmed in 'ptc_client.py', 'ptc.py'**



### 1. Identify the PTC IP Address

On the PTC console:

```bash
ip a
```

From the DUNE server, verify connectivity:

```bash
ping -c 2 <PTC_IP>
```

Successful execution should return ICMP responses from the PTC.



### 2. SSH and login 

```
ssh root@<PTC_IP>
```



### 3. Clone the Repository and transfer to PTC

On the DUNE server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tamago227sk/PTC_development.git
scp -r PTC_development root@<PTC_IP>:~/
cd PTC_development
```

Ensure required build dependencies are available before proceeding.



### 4. Build on the PTC

On the PTC server:

```bash
cd ~/PTC_development
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

Successful completion expect the output:

```
root@ptc:~/PTC_development# ./build.sh
--- Step 1: Generating Protobuf Files (C++ and Python) ---
--- Step 2: Compiling ptc_server ---
--- Step 3: Compiling peek utility ---
--- Step 4: Deployment ---
Build Complete. Binaries installed to /bin/
```


### 5. Start the Server on the PTC

#### Confirm `ptc_server` is running

```bash
ptc_server
```

Expected output:
```
PTC: I2C initialized successfully
PTC: Hardware registers mapped at 0x80020000
PTC Server: Started and listening on port 7820
```

#### Confirm direct register access

```bash
/usr/local/bin/peek 0x800201FC
```

Expected output:

```
0xDEADBEEF
```



### 6. Validation of PTC client

#### Confirm ping function
While keeping the ptc_server running on PTC, execute the client command from /PTC_development/src on dune server
```bash
python ptc_client.py -s 192.168.0.19 ping
```

Expected successful output:

```
PTC alive
```

#### Confirm peek function
While keeping the ptc_server running on PTC, execute the client command from /PTC_development/src on dune server

```bash
python3 src/ptc_client.py -s <PTC_IP> peek 0x800201FC
```

Expected successful output:

```
0xdeadbeef
```

#### Confirm poke function
While keeping the ptc_server running on PTC, execute the client command from /PTC_development/src on dune server

```bash
python3 src/ptc_client.py -s <PTC_IP> peek xxxxxxxxxx
```

Note: xxxxxxxxxx could be any unassigned RW registers (from #13 to #63). For #13, it'd be 0x80020034. The expected value is 0x0 if this resgiter hasn't been re-written.  

Then, execute 
```bash
python3 src/ptc_client.py -s <PTC_IP> poke xxxxxxxxxx 0xA5A5A5A5
```
Note: the value can be anything, but using 0xA5A5A5A5 as an example here. the expected output is 0xa5a5a5a5.

Fianlly, execute 
```bash
python3 src/ptc_client.py -s <PTC_IP> peek xxxxxxxxxx 
```
Confirm it reurns the value that you've typed in previously. 

Successful expected output woudl look like:

```
[skubota@dune01 src]$ python ptc_client.py -s 192.168.0.19 peek 0x80020034
0x0
[skubota@dune01 src]$ python ptc_client.py -s 192.168.0.19 poke 0x80020034 0xA5A5A5A5
0xa5a5a5a5
[skubota@dune01 src]$ python ptc_client.py -s 192.168.0.19 peek 0x80020034
0xa5a5a5a5
```

These confirms the full stack:

* Ethernet communication
* ZMQ REQ/REP transport
* Protobuf command packing
* Server dispatch logic
* Register access through `/dev/mem`

## Running ptc_server on Boot

This section describes how to configure the PTC server to automatically start at boot using a `systemd` service. This replaces older SysV-style (`/etc/rc*.d/`) initialization methods and provides a more robust and maintainable solution.

### Overview

The startup chain is structured as:

```
boot → systemd → ptc_server.service → ptc_init.sh → ptc_server
```

The `ptc_init.sh` script is responsible for performing initialization checks and launching the server.


### 1. Create the systemd Service File

Create the following file:

```
/etc/systemd/system/ptc_server.service
```

With the following contents:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=PTC Server
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/sh /home/root/PTC_development/ptc_init.sh
Restart=always
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


### 2. Ensure the Init Script is Executable

```
chmod +x /home/root/PTC_development/ptc_init.sh
```


### 3. Enable the Service

Reload systemd and enable the service:

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable ptc_server
```


### 4. Start the Service 

```
systemctl start ptc_server
```

Check status:

```
systemctl status ptc_server
```

A successful run should show the service as `active (running)`.


This shoulod have executed the `ptc_init.sh` script, which performs the following steps:

1. Logs startup activity:

   ```
   /var/log/ptc_startup.log
   ```

2. Performs a hardware sanity check:

   ```
   peek 0x800201FC
   ```

   Expected value: `0xDEADBEEF`

3. Starts the server and logs output:

   ```
   /bin/ptc_server >> /var/log/ptc_server.log 2>&1
   ```


### 5. Verification After Reboot

After rebooting the PTC, verify that the server is running:

Check that the port is open:

```
netstat -tuln | grep 7820
```

Check that the process is running:

```
ps aux | grep ptc_server
```

Check connectivity from a remote machine:

```
nc -vz <PTC_IP> 7820
```



### Notes

* The `Restart=always` option ensures the server is automatically restarted if it crashes.
* This configuration assumes that `ptc_server` and `peek` are installed in `/bin/`.
* Logging is handled via files in `/var/log/`, which can be inspected for debugging startup issues.

## I2C on-board Sensor Readout 

This section documents **working, validated commands** for reading on-board sensors through the Python client. These examples reflect the actual hardware mapping currently observed on the PTC.


### Command Format

```bash
python ptc_client.py -s <PTC_IP> <quantity> <mux_channel> <i2c_address> [extra]
```

* `<quantity>`: `temp`, `voltage`, or `current`
* `<mux_channel>`: I2C MUX channel (e.g. `3`)
* `<i2c_address>`: device address in hex (e.g. `0x48`)
* `[extra]`: optional parameter (used for current measurement: shunt resistance)


### Temperature Readout (TMP117)

Temperature sensors are accessible on **MUX channel 3** at the following addresses:

| Address | Typical Reading |
| ------- | --------------- |
| 0x48    | ~45.8 °C        |
| 0x49    | ~33.3 °C        |
| 0x4A    | ~41.0 °C        |

Example usage:

```bash
python ptc_client.py -s 192.168.0.19 temp 3 0x48
→ 45.766 C

python ptc_client.py -s 192.168.0.19 temp 3 0x49
→ 33.289 C

python ptc_client.py -s 192.168.0.19 temp 3 0x4a
→ 41.047 C
```

All TMP117 devices use register `0x00` internally.


### Voltage Readout (LTC2945)

Voltage monitoring is performed via LTC2945 devices:

| Address | Typical Value |
| ------- | ------------- |
| 0x6D    | ~12.2 V       |
| 0x6E    | ~49.0 V       |

Example usage:

```bash
python ptc_client.py -s 192.168.0.19 voltage 3 0x6d
→ 12.225 V

python ptc_client.py -s 192.168.0.19 voltage 3 0x6e
→ 49.000 V
```

Voltage is read from register `0x1E`.



### Current Readout (LTC2945)

Current measurement requires specifying the **shunt resistor value**:

```bash
python ptc_client.py -s <PTC_IP> current <channel> <addr> <R_shunt>
```

* `R_shunt` is in **ohms**

Example usage:

```bash
python ptc_client.py -s 192.168.0.19 current 3 0x6d 0.005
→ 0.895 A

python ptc_client.py -s 192.168.0.19 current 3 0x6d 0.02
→ 0.224 A
```

Current is read from register `0x14`.

**Important:**

* The measured current scales inversely with `R_shunt`
* Incorrect shunt value will produce incorrect current (no warning is issued)


### Device Mapping Summary

| I2C Address | Device  | Register | Quantity    |
| ----------- | ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 0x48–0x4A   | TMP117  | 0x00     | Temperature |
| 0x6D        | LTC2945 | 0x1E     | Voltage     |
| 0x6D        | LTC2945 | 0x14     | Current     |
| 0x6E        | LTC2945 | 0x1E     | Voltage     |
| 0x6E        | LTC2945 | 0x14     | Current     |



### Notes on MUX Channel

All currently working sensors are located behind:

```bash
channel = 3
```

Using a different channel will result in no response from these devices.
